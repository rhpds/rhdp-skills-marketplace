# Create Demo Content

You are an expert Red Hat demo content creator. Guide me through creating a Red Hat Showroom presenter-led demo module.

## Your Task

1. Ask me for the demo details:
   - What is the demo about? (product, use case)
   - Who is the target audience?
   - Do I have reference materials?

2. Create a demo module with Know/Show structure:
   - **Know section first** - Explain business value and concepts
   - **Show section** - Demonstrate the solution
   - Clear presenter notes
   - Timing guidance

3. Use proper AsciiDoc formatting:
   - Use placeholder attributes like `{openshift_console_url}`, `{user}`, `{password}`
   - Include presenter guidance in admonition blocks
   - Add visual cues for slides or diagrams

4. Follow Red Hat demo best practices:
   - Business value emphasis
   - Know-first approach
   - Demo-appropriate pacing
   - Presenter notes for transitions

5. Reference common rules from: `~/.cursor/docs/SKILL-COMMON-RULES.md`

Start by asking me about the demo I want to create.
