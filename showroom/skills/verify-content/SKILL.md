# Content Verification Skill

Verify workshop or demo content against Red Hat quality standards, style guidelines, technical accuracy, and accessibility requirements.

## Workflow Diagram

![Workflow](workflow.svg)

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Have these ready before running this skill:

**Required:**
- 📁 **Path to content directory** - Where your workshop/demo modules are located
  - Example: `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`
- 📝 **Content type** - Know if it's a workshop (hands-on) or demo (presenter-led)

**Helpful to have:**
- ✅ **Completed modules** - Verification works best on finished content
- 📋 **Specific concerns** - Any areas you want extra validation on?
- 🎯 **Target audience** - Who will use this content? (Affects technical depth checks)

**Access needed:**
- ✅ Read permissions to the Showroom repository directory
- ✅ Verification prompts available in:
  - `showroom/prompts/` (repo-specific prompts), or
  - `~/showroom/prompts/` (global prompts), or
  - RHDP marketplace default prompts

**What gets checked:**
- Technical accuracy
- Accessibility compliance (A11y standards)
- Red Hat style guide compliance
- Workshop structure (modules, navigation, learning objectives)
- AsciiDoc formatting and syntax

## When to Use

**Use this skill when you want to**:
- Verify workshop content before publishing
- Check demo modules for quality and completeness
- Validate technical accuracy and Red Hat style compliance
- Review content for accessibility standards
- Get actionable feedback on content improvements

**Don't use this for**:
- Creating new content → use `/create-lab` or `/create-demo`
- Converting between formats → use `/blog-generate`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Verification Prompts (REQUIRED)

Prompts are bundled with the marketplace plugin at `@showroom/prompts/`. Read them directly — no detection or user choice needed.

```
📋 Verification prompts loaded from marketplace plugin.
```

Proceed immediately to Step 1.5.

---

### Step 1.5: Showroom Scaffold Check

Silently check all scaffold files in the repo root and `content/`. Do not check AgnosticV or any external catalog. Do not block verification — collect all findings and include them in the Step 5 results summary.

**Known stale/template title values** — flag any of these as not updated:
`Workshop Title`, `Lab Title`, `Showroom Template`, `Red Hat Showroom`, `My Workshop`, `Template`, `showroom_template_nookbag`, empty string, or a value matching the repository directory name.

---

**Antora playbook** (`site.yml` or `default-site.yml`) (repo root):

The showroom role supports both `site.yml` and `default-site.yml` — both are valid. `site.yml` is the going-forward standard. `default-site.yml` is silently supported by the role. You can also override with `ocp4_workload_showroom_content_antora_playbook: custom.yml`.

Check which file is present and use whichever exists for field validation:

| State | Severity | Message |
|---|---|---|
| `site.yml` present | — | Proceed to field checks on `site.yml` |
| `default-site.yml` present, no `site.yml` | High | ⚠️ Repo uses `default-site.yml` — rename to `site.yml` (new standard). Both work but `site.yml` is going forward. Fix: `mv default-site.yml site.yml` |
| Both present | High | ⚠️ Both `site.yml` and `default-site.yml` exist — `default-site.yml` is redundant. Remove it: `rm default-site.yml` |
| Neither present | Critical | ❌ No Antora playbook found. Showroom cannot build. Run `/showroom:create-lab --new` to scaffold. |

Check fields in whichever playbook file is present:

| Field | Check | Message if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `site.title` | Not a stale/template value | ⚠️ `site.title` looks like a template default — update to your actual lab name |
| `site.start_page` | Equals `modules::index.adoc` | ⚠️ `start_page` is not `modules::index.adoc` — learners may land on wrong page |
| `ui.bundle.url` | Present and not empty | ⚠️ `ui.bundle.url` missing — Showroom will use default theme |
| `ui.supplemental_files` | Equals `./supplemental-ui` | ⚠️ `supplemental_files` path is wrong — custom CSS/partials won't load |
| `runtime.fetch` | Equals `true` | ⚠️ `runtime.fetch` not set to true — remote content sources won't update |

---

**`ui-config.yml`** (repo root):

If MISSING:
```
❌  ui-config.yml not found
    Showroom 1.5.1 requires this file for split-view and tab configuration.
    Run /showroom:create-lab --new to scaffold.
```

If found — check:

| Field | Check | Message if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `type: showroom` | Present at top | ⚠️ `type: showroom` missing — Showroom won't recognize this config |
| `view_switcher.enabled` | Equals `true` | ⚠️ Split screen not enabled — learners can't switch between split and full-screen modes |
| `view_switcher.default_mode` | Equals `split` | ⚠️ Default mode is not `split` — learners start in full-screen, may not notice the panel |
| `tabs:` section | Has at least one uncommented entry | ⚠️ No consoles configured — learners will see no embedded tools in the right panel |
| `persist_url_state` | Equals `true` | ⚠️ `persist_url_state` not set — browser refresh resets the UI position |

---

**`content/antora.yml`**:

If MISSING:
```
❌  content/antora.yml not found
    Antora cannot build without it.
```

If found — check:

| Field | Check | Message if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Not a stale/template value | ⚠️ `title` in antora.yml looks like a template default — update to your actual lab name |
| `name` | Equals `modules` | ⚠️ `name` is not `modules` — navigation xrefs will break |
| `start_page` | Equals `index.adoc` | ⚠️ `start_page` is not `index.adoc` — learners may land on wrong page |
| `nav` list | Contains `modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` | ⚠️ `nav` does not reference `modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` — sidebar navigation won't render |
| `asciidoc.attributes.lab_name` | Present and not stale | ⚠️ `lab_name` attribute missing or still a template value — attribute placeholders in content won't resolve |

---

**`content/lib/`** — 4 JS extension files:

Check each file individually. Report any that are missing:

```
⚠️  Missing content/lib files:
    - content/lib/attributes-page-extension.js
    Dynamic attribute injection will not work.
    Run /showroom:create-lab --new to copy from reference repo.
```

Files checked:
- `content/lib/all-attributes-console-extension.js`
- `content/lib/attributes-page-extension.js`
- `content/lib/dev-mode.js`
- `content/lib/unlisted-pages-extension.js`

---

**`supplemental-ui/`** — 4 UI asset files:

Check each. Report missing:

```
⚠️  Missing supplemental-ui files:
    - supplemental-ui/css/site-extra.css
    Custom styling won't be applied.
```

Files checked:
- `supplemental-ui/css/site-extra.css`
- `supplemental-ui/img/favicon.ico`
- `supplemental-ui/partials/head-meta.hbs`
- `supplemental-ui/partials/header-content.hbs`

---

**`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`**:

If MISSING:
```
❌  .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml not found
    GitHub Pages auto-deploy won't work.
    Run /showroom:create-lab --new to create.
```

If found — check the `antora generate` command references the correct playbook, then remind the user to verify GitHub Pages is enabled:

```
ℹ️  Remember: GitHub Pages must be enabled in repo Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
    Without this, the workflow runs but nothing is published (404 on the guide URL).
```



Determine which playbook file the repo uses (`site.yml` or `default-site.yml`), then check the workflow references it:

| Workflow references | Repo has | Severity | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| `site.yml` | `site.yml` | — | ✓ Correct |
| `default-site.yml` | `site.yml` | Critical | ❌ `gh-pages.yml` runs `antora generate default-site.yml` but repo has `site.yml` — build will fail. Fix: change to `antora generate site.yml` |
| `default-site.yml` | `default-site.yml` | High | ⚠️ `gh-pages.yml` references `default-site.yml`. If you rename to `site.yml` (recommended), also update the workflow. |
| `site.yml` | `default-site.yml` | Critical | ❌ `gh-pages.yml` runs `antora generate site.yml` but repo only has `default-site.yml` — build will fail. Fix: rename `default-site.yml` → `site.yml` |

---

Include all scaffold findings in the Step 5 results under a dedicated **"Scaffold Issues"** section, listed before content quality issues. Severity: missing required files = Critical, stale title/missing optional fields = High.

---

### Step 2: Identify Content Type

**Q: What type of content are you verifying?**

Options:
1. Workshop module (hands-on lab content)
2. Demo module (presenter-led demonstration)
3. Multiple files (specify pattern)

### Step 3: Locate Content

**For single file**:
- Provide file path (e.g., `content/modules/ROOT/pages/module-01-install-aap.adoc`)

**For multiple files**:
- Provide glob pattern (e.g., `content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc`)
- Or directory path (e.g., `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`)

### Step 4: Run Verification — Checklist Mode

**Why checklist mode:** Open-ended review produces inconsistent results — the model notices different things each run. A numbered checklist forces an explicit PASS/FAIL for every item, so nothing is silently skipped.

**Rules:**
- Run ONE pass at a time. Output its full result table before starting the next pass.
- Every check item MUST produce exactly one of: `PASS`, `FAIL: <file>:<line> — <detail>`, or `N/A: <reason>`
- `N/A` is only valid when the check genuinely does not apply (e.g. accessibility checks on a nav.adoc file)
- Do NOT group items. Do NOT say "several issues found" without listing each one individually.
- After all passes complete, re-read the checklist and confirm no item was left blank.

Use `@showroom/prompts/` files as reference criteria for each pass, but the driver is the explicit numbered list below — not the prompts.

---

#### PASS B: Structure and Learning Design

Read all files in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`. For each check, state which file and line the evidence comes from.

| # | Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| B.1 | `index.adoc` exists | File present |
| B.2 | `index.adoc` is learner-facing (not facilitator guide) | Does not start with "This guide helps facilitators..." |
| B.3 | `01-overview.adoc` exists with business scenario | File present, contains company/scenario context |
| B.4 | `02-details.adoc` exists with technical requirements | File present |
| B.5 | At least one hands-on module exists (`03-*` or higher) | ≥1 module file |
| B.6 | `nav.adoc` exists and includes all module files | All `*.adoc` in pages/ listed in nav.adoc |
| B.7 | Conclusion module exists (`*conclusion*.adoc`) | File present |
| B.8 | Each module has learning objectives (3+ items) | `== Learning Objectives` or equivalent section with bullets |
| B.9 | Each module has at least 2 exercises | ≥2 `== Exercise` or equivalent sections |
| B.10 | Exercise steps use numbered lists (`.`) not bullets (`*`) | Sequential actions use `.` |
| B.11 | Learning objectives use bullets (`*`) not numbers (`.`) | Concepts/outcomes use `*` |
| B.12 | Every exercise has a `=== Verify` section with expected output | Present after each major task |
| B.13 | No individual module has a `== References` section | References only in conclusion |
| B.14 | Conclusion has `== What You've Learned` section | Present in conclusion |
| B.15 | Conclusion has `== References` section consolidating all module refs | Present in conclusion |

Output result table for PASS B before continuing.

---

#### PASS C: AsciiDoc Formatting

Scan every `.adoc` file in the content directory.

| # | Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| C.1 | All `image::` macros include `link=self,window=blank` | No image without this parameter |
| C.2 | All images have non-empty descriptive alt text | Not blank, not "image", not filename |
| C.3 | All external links use `^` caret (new tab) | `link:https://...[\[text^\]]` pattern |
| C.4 | Internal `xref:` links do NOT use `^` caret | `xref:file.adoc[text]` (no caret) |
| C.5 | Code blocks use `[source,<lang>]` with language specified | Not bare `----` blocks |
| C.6 | No em dashes (`—`) anywhere in content | Zero occurrences |
| C.7 | Lists have blank line before and after | No lists immediately adjacent to text |
| C.8 | Document title uses `= ` (single equals, one space) | First line of each file |
| C.9 | All headings are sentence case (not Title Case) | No mid-word capitals in headings |
| C.10 | No `include::` referencing files that don't exist | All includes resolve |

Output result table for PASS C before continuing.

---

#### PASS D: Red Hat Style Guide

Scan all content files. Reference `@showroom/prompts/redhat_style_guide_validation.txt` for full criteria.

| # | Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| D.1 | No "the Red Hat OpenShift Platform" — use "Red Hat OpenShift" | Zero occurrences |
| D.2 | No bare "OCP", "AAP", "RHOAI" without first-use expansion | Acronyms spelled out on first use |
| D.3 | No prohibited vague terms: "robust", "powerful", "leverage", "synergy", "game-changer" | Zero occurrences |
| D.4 | No unsupported superlatives: "best", "leading", "most" without citation | Zero bare superlatives |
| D.5 | No non-inclusive terms: "whitelist/blacklist", "master/slave" | Zero occurrences — use "allowlist/denylist", "primary/replica" |
| D.6 | Numbers 0-9 written as numerals, not words | "3 steps" not "three steps" |
| D.7 | Oxford comma used in lists of 3+ items | "X, Y, and Z" pattern |
| D.8 | No em dashes used (style rule, duplicate of C.6 for completeness) | Zero occurrences |
| D.9 | No "he/she" — use "they/them" for gender-neutral | Zero gendered pronouns |
| D.10 | Product version numbers match environment or use `{ocp_version}` placeholder | No hardcoded version mismatches |

Output result table for PASS D before continuing.

---

#### PASS E: Technical Accuracy and Accessibility

| # | Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| E.1 | All `oc` CLI commands use lowercase subcommands | `oc get pods` not `oc Get Pods` |
| E.2 | YAML code blocks have consistent indentation (2 spaces) | No mixed tabs/spaces |
| E.3 | Expected command outputs are present after commands | Each `[source,bash]` block followed by expected output |
| E.4 | No hardcoded cluster URLs, usernames, or passwords | Use `{openshift_console_url}`, `{user}`, `{password}` |
| E.5 | All `{attribute}` placeholders are defined in `antora.yml` or `_attributes.adoc` | No undefined attributes |
| E.6 | All images have alt text (WCAG accessibility) | No `image::[,]` with empty first bracket |
| E.7 | Heading hierarchy has no skipped levels (e.g. `=` then `===` skipping `==`) | Correct nesting throughout |
| E.8 | No instructions reference UI elements that don't exist in current OCP version | e.g. no deprecated menu paths |
| E.9 | Code examples are syntactically valid for stated language | YAML/JSON/bash syntax correct |

Output result table for PASS E before continuing.

---

#### PASS F: Demo-specific (skip if workshop content)

| # | Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| F.1 | Each section has Know (context/why) before Show (demonstration) | Know/Show structure present |
| F.2 | Business value is stated for each demonstration | ROI/outcome framing present |
| F.3 | Presenter notes present (`[NOTE]` blocks or aside sections) | Guidance for presenter exists |
| F.4 | No hands-on exercises requiring participant input | Demo is presenter-led only |
| F.5 | Key talking points highlighted for each section | Callout or note blocks used |

Output result table for PASS F before continuing.

---

**After all passes:** Scan the checklist from B.1 to E.9 (and F.1-F.5 if applicable). Confirm every item has an explicit result. If any item has no result, address it before generating the report.

### Step 5: Present Results

I'll provide results in this order:

**1. Scaffold Issues FIRST** (from Step 1.5):
- Missing required files (Critical)
- Stale/template titles, wrong paths, missing view_switcher (High)

**2. Checklist FAIL items** (from Step 4 passes B–F):
- Group by pass (B: Structure, C: AsciiDoc, D: Style, E: Technical, F: Demo)
- For each FAIL: check ID, file:line, what is wrong, before/after, exact fix
- Do NOT list PASS items here — only FAILs

**3. Validation Summary Table LAST**:
- One row per FAIL item: Check ID | Issue | Priority | File:Line
- Priority: Critical (scaffold missing, broken navigation), High (style, missing verifications), Medium (formatting), Low (suggestions)
- Total FAIL count by pass

**4. Strengths Section** (after summary table):
- What your content does exceptionally well
- Positive highlights to reinforce good practices
- Recognition of quality work

**CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:**
- Summary table comes LAST, not first
- Detailed sections are at the TOP
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY after strengths section**
- **DO NOT add any additional summaries, assessments, or recaps**
- **NO "Overall Assessment", NO "Quick Stats", NO "Top 3 Fixes"**
- **NO text after strengths - that's the END of output**

The output must end with the strengths section. Nothing comes after it.

### Step 6: Offer Fixes (Optional)

After showing results, I can:
- Apply fixes automatically (with your approval)
- Provide code snippets for manual fixes
- Explain why each change improves quality
