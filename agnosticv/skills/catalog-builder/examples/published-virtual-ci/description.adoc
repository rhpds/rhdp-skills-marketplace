This hands-on workshop guides students through building production-ready agentic AI applications on Red Hat OpenShift AI using Llama Stack, LangGraph, Langfuse, Langflow and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Students will progress from deploying a Llama Stack distribution to creating AI agents that interact with enterprise backend systems, implementing safety guardrails, RAG capabilities, and web search integration. The workshop culminates in deploying a complete full-stack AI agent application with tracing, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms, providing comprehensive experience in building and operating enterprise-grade AI systems.
